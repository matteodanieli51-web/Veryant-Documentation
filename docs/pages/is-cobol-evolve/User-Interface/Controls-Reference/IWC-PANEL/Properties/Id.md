## Id

This property allows you to assign a unique ID to the IWC-Panel control.

This is the information the variables *event-control-id* and *control-id* refer to. Both variables are defined in [iscrt.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/iscrt.def).

**Example** - Define an iwc-panel with id

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-ip-1 Iwc-Panel
     line 22.0
     column 10.0
     size 11.0 cells
     lines 3.0 cells
     id 10
     js-name "f-map"
     .
...
```
