## Id

This property allows you to assign a unique ID to the Tree-View control.

This is the information the variables *event-control-id* and *control-id* refer to. Both variables are defined in [iscrt.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/iscrt.def).

**Example** - Define a tree-view with an ID

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-tv-1 Tree-View
     line 2.7
     column 3.4
     size 20.8 cells
     lines 29.1 cells
     color 144
     id 2
     no-box
     .
```
