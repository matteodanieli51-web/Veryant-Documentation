## Layout-data

The Layout Manager can use this data to help determine the way to show the control. Each manager forces its own interpretation of the meaning of this data.

This property can have either numeric values (defined in the [isresize.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/isresize.def) Copybook) or alphanumeric values, depending on the Layout Manager associated to the window. See [Layout managers](../../../Working-With-UI-and-Controls/Creating-a-control/Layout-managers/Layout-managers) for more information.

**Example** - Define a list-box that allows resize in X and Y when the layout manager requires so

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-lb-1 List-Box
     line 5.7
     column 3.1
     size 34.6 cells
     lines 15.5 cells
     id 1
     layout-data 17
     .
...
```
