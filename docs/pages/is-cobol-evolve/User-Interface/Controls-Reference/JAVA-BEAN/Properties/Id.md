## Id

This property allows you to assign a unique ID to the Java-Bean control.

This is the information the variables *event-control-id* and *control-id* refer to. Both variables are defined in [iscrt.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/iscrt.def).

**Example** - Define a Java-bean with id

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-jb-1 Java-Bean
     line 5.1
     column 4.5
     size 33.5 cells
     lines 25.1 cells
     background-color 8
     foreground-color 3
     id 1
     no-box
     bitmap-width 18
     .
...
```
