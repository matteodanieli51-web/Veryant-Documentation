## Event-List

This property specifies a list of events that may or may not be fired depending on the value of the [Exclude-Event-List](./Exclude-Event-List) property. The property requires a sequence of numeric values. It’s suggested that you use the constant values defined in the [isgui.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/isgui.def) copybook. Multiple values must be enclosed between parenthesis and separated by a space.

**Example** - Display a Ribbon without firing the cmd-tabchanged event

```cobol
procedure division.
...
  display ribbon
          tab-to-add ( "Page-1" "Page-2")
          bitmap-number ( 0 0)
          lines 4.4375
          color 134
          id 6
          bitmap-width 16
          event-list ( cmd-tabchanged )
          exclude-event-list 1
          handle screen-1-rbn-1-hdl
          .
...
```
