## Event-List

This property specifies a list of events that may or may not be fired depending on the value of the [Exclude-Event-List](./Exclude-Event-List) property. The property requires a sequence of numeric values. It’s suggested that you use the constant values defined in the [isgui.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/isgui.def) copybook. Multiple values must be enclosed between parenthesis and separated by a space.

**Example** - Define a tab-control with an excluded event-list

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-tc-1 Tab-Control
     line 2.8
     column 25.7
     size 34.6 cells
     lines 28.9 cells
     enabled 0
     id 10
     event-list ( cmd-help )
     exclude-event-list 1
     .
```
