## Layout-data

The Layout Manager can use this data to help determine the way to show the control. Each manager forces its own interpretation of the meaning of this data.

This property can have either numeric values (defined in the [isresize.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/isresize.def) Copybook) or alphanumeric values, depending on the Layout Manager associated to the window. See [Layout managers](../../../Working-With-UI-and-Controls/Creating-a-control/Layout-managers/Layout-managers) for more information.

**Example -** Define a check-box that allows resize on X and Y when the window is resizing when a layout manager is defined for the screen

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-cb-2 Check-Box
     line 27.0
     column 10.0
     size 156
     lines 31
     id 11
     layout-data 17 |*> To allow X and Y resizing
     .
```
