## Exclude-Event-List

If this property is set to "1", then none of the events in the [Event-List](./Event-List) property are fired. If this property is set to "0", then only the events listed in the [Event-List](./Event-List) property are fired. If it’s omitted, then all the events are fired. Preventing the runtime from generating some events may speed up performance in client/server environments.

**Note -** Excluding focus change events like CMD-GOTO and MSG-VALIDATE may avoid AFTER and BEFORE embedded procedures to be triggered.

**Example -** Define a check-box in screen section and define the only events to fire for it

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-cb-2 Check-Box
     line 27.0
     column 10.0
     size 116
     lines 31
     id 11
     event-list ( cmd-clicked msg-validate)
     exclude-event-list 0
     flat
     title "My Check Box"
     .
```
