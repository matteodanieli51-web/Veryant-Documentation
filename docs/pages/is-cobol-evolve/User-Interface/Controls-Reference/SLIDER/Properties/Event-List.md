## Event-List

This property specifies a list of events that may or may not be fired depending on the value of the [Exclude-Event-List](./Exclude-Event-List) property. The property requires a sequence of numeric values. It’s suggested that you use the constant values defined in the [isgui.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/isgui.def) copybook. Multiple values must be enclosed between parenthesis and separated by a space.

**Example** - Define a slide-bar with a list of events to be excluded
