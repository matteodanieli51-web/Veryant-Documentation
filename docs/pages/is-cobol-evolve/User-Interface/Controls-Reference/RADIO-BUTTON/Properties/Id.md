## Id

This property allows you to assign a unique ID to the Radio-Button control.

This is the information the variables *event-control-id* and *control-id* refer to. Both variables are defined in [iscrt.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/iscrt.def).

**Example** - Define a radio button with an ID number

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-rb-2 Radio-Button
     line 20.6
     column 21.7
     size 10.9 cells
     lines 5.4 cells
     id 5
     hint "Select this as alternative option"
     title "Option 2"
     .
```
