## Exclude-Event-List

If this property is set to "1", then none of the events in the [Event-List](./Event-List) property are fired. If this property is set to "0", then only the events listed in the [Event-List](./Event-List) property are fired. If it’s omitted, then all the events are fired. Preventing the runtime from generating some events may speed up performance in client/server environments.

**Note -** Excluding focus change events like CMD-GOTO and MSG-VALIDATE may avoid AFTER and BEFORE embedded procedures to be triggered.

**Example** - Define a radio button with a list of events to be excluded
