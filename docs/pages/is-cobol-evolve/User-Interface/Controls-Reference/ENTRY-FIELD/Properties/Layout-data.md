## Layout-data

The The Layout Manager can use this data to help determine the way to show the control. Each manager forces its own interpretation of the meaning of this data.

This property can have either numeric values (defined in the [isresize.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/isresize.def) Copybook) or alphanumeric values, depending on the Layout Manager associated to the window. See [Layout managers](../../../Working-With-UI-and-Controls/Creating-a-control/Layout-managers/Layout-managers) for more information.

**Example** - Define an entry-field that allows resize in X and Y when the layout manager requires so

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-ef-2 Entry-Field
     line 29.0
     column 49.5
     size 13.1 cells
     lines 4.6 cells
     id 19
     layout-data 17
     3-d.
```
