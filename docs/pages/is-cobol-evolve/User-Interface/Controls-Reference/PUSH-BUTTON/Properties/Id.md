## Id

This property allows you to assign a unique ID to the Push-Button control.

This is the information the variables *event-control-id* and *control-id* refer to. Both variables are defined in [iscrt.def](../../../../Appendices/Copybooks/iscrt.def).

**Example** - Define a push-button with an ID

```cobol
screen section.
...
  03 screen-1-pb-1 Push-Button
     line 4.5
     column 8.1
     size 12.5 cells
     lines 4.8 cells
     id 1
     title "Accept"
     .
```
